# CSCI-299-New-Project

Context: A browser-based Spring Boot Blackjack game where players start with ten points to bet.
Challenges: Implementing accurate points tracking, seamless integration between backend and frontend, and smooth game flow.
Approach:
- Backend: A Player, Deck, Blackjack, Card, and Dealer class for game management and a BlackjackController for game logic.
- Frontend: Simple, clean interface showing points and bets.
- Testing: Focused on edge cases, like running out of points.

Results: A functional and fun Blackjack experience that runs efficiently in a browser.
Recommendations: Officially host a site for the program.
