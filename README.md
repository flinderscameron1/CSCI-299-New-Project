# CSCI-299-New-Project

The browser-based Spring Boot Blackjack game provides players with ten points to start betting, ensuring an engaging and strategic experience. The main challenges involved implementing accurate points tracking, smooth game flow, and seamless backend-to-frontend integration. The backend architecture consists of Player, Deck, Blackjack, Card, and Dealer classes for game management, with a dedicated BlackjackController handling logic. The frontend features a simple, intuitive interface displaying points and bets, while testing focused on edge cases like running out of points. As a result, the game runs efficiently in a browser, delivering a functional and enjoyable Blackjack experience. A key recommendation is to officially host a site for broader accessibility and engagement.
